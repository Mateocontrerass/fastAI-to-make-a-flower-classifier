# Flower Classifier

Do you have a passion for gardening or simply love exploring the beauty of different flowers? Look no further! This project introduces a sophisticated flower classifier capable of identifying over 100 different species of flowers with an impressive accuracy exceeding 95%.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a powerful machine learning model capable of recognizing nearly any common flower. This classifier can be a valuable tool for various applications, including aiding in the identification of wildflowers for wildlife conservation, assisting gardening enthusiasts, and contributing to educational initiatives.

## Data

The model was trained on the Oxford 102 Flower Dataset, available [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). This dataset comprises 102 flower categories, totaling 8189 images. The dataset was divided into a training set (6149 images), a validation set (1020 images), and a test set (1020 images). The training set facilitated model training, the validation set evaluated performance, and the test set assessed the model's accuracy on previously unseen data.

Data preprocessing included resizing images to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values.
